# Stellar Classification Project ðŸŒŸ

Welcome to the Stellar Classification project repository! This project, conducted in collaboration with **Debolina Chatterjee** and **Siddhartha Sinha**, focuses on classifying stars, galaxies, and quasars using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Leveraging advanced statistical analysis and machine learning models, we achieved significant results in the field of astronomical data science.

## Project Overview

### Data Source

The dataset used for this project was obtained from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and consists of **100,000** observations of celestial objects, including stars, galaxies, and quasars.

### Objectives

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** To clean and preprocess the dataset for analysis and modeling.
- **Statistical Analysis:** To perform detailed statistical analysis to uncover significant insights.
- **Machine Learning:** To build and evaluate various machine learning models for stellar classification.

## Project Highlights

### 1. Data Analysis

- **Data Cleaning:** Comprehensive cleaning to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data consistency.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualized data distributions, correlations, and trends.

### 2. Statistical Analysis

- **T-tests & ANOVA:** Used to identify statistically significant differences across celestial classes.
- **Regression Models:** Applied linear and logistic regression to understand relationships between variables.

### 3. Machine Learning Models

We evaluated multiple machine learning models for the classification task:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Random Forest**
- **Gradient Boosting**

**Top Performers:**
- **Gradient Boosting** and **Random Forest** models stood out, achieving accuracy rates exceeding **90%**.

## Key Findings

- **Descriptive Statistics:** Provided insights into the distribution and characteristics of the data.
- **Significant Differences:** Statistical tests confirmed significant spectral differences across celestial objects.
- **Model Performance:** Advanced machine learning models delivered robust classification performance, with Gradient Boosting and Random Forest leading the pack.
